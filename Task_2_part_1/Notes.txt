Problem 1:
- File managers are redundant
-- Solution ======> introduced a generic base class "FileManager<T>" for all file managers with
a default implementation of its methods (virtual methods)

Problem 2 (based on 1):
- Type parameter of the generic class must have the two functions of the file (save - load)
-- Solution ======> introduced "IFile" as a contract for all files and added a constraint
on "T" to implement it
